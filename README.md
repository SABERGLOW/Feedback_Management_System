# Feedback Management System
An object oriented C++ Program which stores and maintains course feedback provided by students. [Semester Project]


# Overview:
The program is designed to store and maintain data about feedbacks provided by students about courses offered by any university/educational institution. The feedback consists of various questions about the course, its content, efficiency of teaching methods, and so on. The feedback once submitted can be viewed/managed by the administrator.  
As a student, you can fill-out the feedback form and view your submitted feedbacks, while the administrator has much more flexibility. The abilities range from adding/removing students to adding/removing questions in feedback form. We achieve that by making use of file handling, and strings generally. But as we proceed further in this document, you will understand the full functionality of the program.
